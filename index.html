            Chhath is an ancient Hindu festival historically native to the Indian subcontinent, more specifically, the
            Indian states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh,West Bengal, Jharkhand,
            and the Nepalese provinces of Madhesh and Lumbini. Prayers during Chhath puja are dedicated to the solar
            deity, Surya, to show gratitude and thankfulness for bestowing the bounties of life on earth and to request
            that certain wishes be granted.

            Chhathi Maiya, the sixth form of Devi Prakriti and Lord Surya's sister is worshipped as the Goddess of the
            festival. It is celebrated six days after Deepavali, on the sixth day of the lunar month of Kartika
            (October–November) in the Hindu calendar Vikram Samvat. The rituals are observed over four days. They
            include holy bathing, fasting and abstaining from drinking water (vrata), standing in water, and offering
            prasad (prayer offerings) and arghya to the setting and rising sun. Some devotees also perform a prostration
            march as they head for the river banks.</span>

        <div id="desc">Chhath Puja ritual starts on the fourth day of Kartika month, Puja begins with Nahay Khay.
            The word Nahay Khay, Nahai means to bathe, and Khai means to eat. On the first day of Nahai Khai,
            devotees take a holy bath in a holy lake or river, to purify their sins. Then, they worship Lord Surya.
            Water from the holy river is carried to homes, which is later used in cooking food offerings for Surya
            which then continues for the next 36 hours.<br>
            On this day devotees eats rice, gram pulses, and pumpkin vegetables sans onion and garlic. After eating
            the food sometime mid-noon, the Parvatin (devotee) starts the water-less-fast which is broken only the
            next day evening while observing 'Kharna' the second day of Chhath Puja. During this period of three
            nights and four days, the worshiper observes purity and sleeps on the floor. Since it falls in winter, a
            bed on rice straws is made by putting a blanket on it.

On this day, there is a special glow on the ghats and women sing the songs of Chhathi Mata. Morning Argha is given along with the sunrise and thus ends the Parana of Chhath Puja. Only after this Prasad is given at the Ghats.
